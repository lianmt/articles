> ###The pith of love
> ###爱的本心
> **A pity beyond all telling
遗憾超过了所有的言语
Is hid in the heart of love:
所有的爱都埋藏在了心底
The folk who are buying and selling,
繁华市场
The clouds on their journey above,
万里无云
The cold wet winds ever blowing,
寒风萧瑟
And the shadowy hazel grove
幽静榛树林
Where mouse-grey waters are flowing,
哪儿的浑水在流动？
Threaten the head that I love.
影响着我的爱心！**
