> ### The living beauty
### 生活的美

> **I bade, because the wick and oil are spent
我胆怯，因为灯芯和灯油快燃尽了
And frozen are the channels of the blood,
冷冻是血液的通道
My discontented heart to draw content
我不满意的作画
From beauty that is cast out of a mould 
模具表现的美
In bronze, or that in dazzling marble appears,
从青铜中，从大理石中
Appears, but when we have gone is gone again,
所有的美都尽显出来，但是当我们走了的时候
Being more indifferent to our solitude
却改变不了我们的孤独
Than 'twere an apparition. O heart, we are old;
只是一个感觉。哎，我们老了
The living beauty is for younger men:
美丽的人是年轻人的专属
We cannot pay its tribute of wild tears.
我们因青春逝去而痛哭涕零。**
