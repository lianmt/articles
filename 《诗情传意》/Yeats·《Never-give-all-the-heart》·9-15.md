永远不要为了爱倾尽所有
Will hardly seem worth thinking of 
本来就该如此
To passionate women if it seem
对热情的女人
Certain, and they never dream
当然，他们从来不会这样去想
That it fades out from kiss to kiss;
他们会从亲吻中消失
For everything that's lovely is
所有可爱的东西都是
O never give the heart outright,
啊，别把你的心完全交出来
For they, for all smooth lips can say,
可以这么说，是为了他们，是为了所有诱人的嘴唇
Have given their hearts up to the play.
他们对这场游戏很感兴趣
And who could play it well enough 
谁能从这场游戏中胜出呢
If deaf and dumb and blind with love
如果充耳不闻，盲目地去爱
He that made this knows all the cost,
做这些事情他知道要付出的代价
For he gave all his heart and lost.
因为他付出了所有的真心和失去了所有**
