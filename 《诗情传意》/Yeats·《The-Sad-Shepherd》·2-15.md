# The Sad Shepherd
# 悲伤的牧羊人

> **There was a man whom Sorrow named his friend,
有一个人，悲伤是他的朋友
And he, of his high comrade Sorrow dreaming,
他悲伤地梦想着
Went walking with slow steps along the gleaming
缓慢地走着
And humming sands, where windy surges wend:
嗡嗡地沙子，带风的浪潮
And he called loudly to the stars to bend
他的声音太大，使星星看过去想弯曲一样
From their pale thrones and comfort him, but they 
苍白的宝座安慰着他，可他们呢
And then the man whom Sorrow named his friend 
只有那个悲伤的人给他的朋友取名
Cried out, Dim sea, hear my most piteous story!
哭了，昏暗的海，听我可悲的故事！
The sea swept on and cried her old cry still,
像大海一样席卷而来，她哭了，她又哭了起来
Rolling along in dreams from hill to hill.
梦想像一座座山翻滚一番。**

> **He fled the persecution of her glory 
她逃离了迫害她的荣耀
Cried all his story to the dewdrops glistening.
为她的故事而哭泣，泪滴闪闪发光。
But naught they heard, for they are always listening,
但是他们没有听到，因为他们已经听惯了，
The dewdrops, for the sound of their own dropping.
孤单的落泪
And then the man whom Sorrow named his friend 
他的朋友给他取名为悲伤
Sought once again the shore, and found a shell,
他再一次到了岸边，发现了这个贝壳
And thought, I will my heavy story tell
他思考，我要把我的故事告诉它
Till my own words, re-echoing, shall send
我把我的故事告诉了贝壳，它回想着我的故事，直到永远
Their sadness through a hollow, pearly heart;
他们的悲伤穿过空洞的珍珠般的心
And my own tale again for me shall sing, 
它将再次歌唱我的故事
And my own whispering words be comforting,
在我耳边安慰着我
And lo! my ancient burden may depart.
是啊！过去的负担都会过去。
Then he sang softly night the pearly rim;
然后她温柔的歌声伴随着黑夜
But the sad dweller by the sea-ways lone
但悲伤的渔夫独自在海边
Changed all he sang to inarticulate moan
他改变了所有的歌声，那不可思议的呻吟
Among her wildering whirls, forgetting him.
她迷失在漩涡之中，忘了她吧！**
