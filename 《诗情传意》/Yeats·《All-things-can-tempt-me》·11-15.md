> ### All things can tempt me
### 所有的东西都可能诱惑我

> ** All things can tempt me from this craft of verse:
所有的东西都可能诱惑我，从这首诗中
One item it was a woman's face, or worse——
特别是女人的脸，更甚是——
The seeming needs of my fool-driven land;
我那机械式的土地需要
Now nothing but comes readier to the hand
现在只不过是靠双手
Than this accustomed toil. When I was young,
比这习惯的更辛劳。在我年轻的时候
I had not given a penny for a song
我没有给一分钱唱一首歌
Did not the poet sing it with such airs
诗人不是这样唱的吗
That one believed he had a sword upstairs;
那个人相信他有一把剑在楼上；
Yet would be now, could I but have my wish,
然而现在，我能拥有的我的愿望吗
Colder and dumber and deafer than a fish.
比鱼更哑更聋的
