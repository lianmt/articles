> ###The sorrow of love
> ###爱的悲哀
> **The brawling of a sparrow in the eaves,
麻雀在屋檐上叽叽咋咋
The brillian moon and all the milky sky,
明亮地月光照亮夜空
And all that famous harmony of leaves,
树叶显得那么的安宁和谐
Had blotted out man's image and his cry.
遮住了人们的脸连同她们的眼泪**

> **A girl arose that had red mournful lips
一个年轻红唇女孩显得很忧伤
And seemed the greatness of the world in tears,
似乎世界也伤感了起来
Doomed like Odysseus and the labouring ships.
她的命运就像Odysseus和他的船只一样
And proud as Priam murdered with his peers;
像Priam的同龄人一样被谋杀的自豪**

> **Arose, and on the instant clamorous eaves,
醒来，在这个瞬间吵闹的屋檐下
A climbing moon upon an empty sky,
月亮悬挂在高空中
And all that lamentation of the leaves,
所有哀伤的叶子
Could but compose man's image and his cry.
就像人们的脸和她们的眼泪**
