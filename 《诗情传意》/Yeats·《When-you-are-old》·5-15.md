> ### When you are old
### 当你老了

> **When you are old and grey and full of sleep,
当你老了，头发斑白，充满睡意
And nodding by the fire, take down this book,
在炉火旁打盹，取下了这本书
And slowly read, and dream of the soft look
慢慢的读，想象一下你柔和的眼神
Your eyes had once, and of their shadows deep,;
你的眼睛有一次，浮现他深沉的影子**

> **How many loved your moments of glad grace,
多少人爱你的青春，那些欢乐的时刻
And loved your bearty with love false or true,
爱慕你的美丽假意或真心
But one man loved the pilgrim soul in you,
只有一个人爱你朝圣者的灵魂
And loved the sorrows of your changing face;
爱着你老去沧桑的脸**

>** And bending down beside the glowing bars,
垂下头来
Murmur, a little sadly, how Love fled
凄然地诉说那爱情的消逝
And paced upon the mountains overhead
在山顶上缓缓踱着步子
And hid his face amid a crowd of stars.
在一群星星中隐藏着脸庞**
